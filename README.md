# Nest.js Full Course - Improvement and Development

This repository contains my studies and practical applications from the **Nest.js Full Course for Beginners**, a comprehensive 3-hour course covering the essential fundamentals of Nest.js. My goal with this project is to deepen my knowledge of Nest.js and its key functionalities, enhancing my skills with a widely used market tool.

## 💡 About the Course
The course is structured into six main chapters, each covering fundamental aspects of Nest.js:

1. **Introduction** - Overview of Nest.js and its ecosystem.
2. **Controllers** - Implementation and routing of requests.
3. **Providers** - Dependency injection and services.
4. **DTO Validation** - Data validation patterns and use of DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
5. **REST API** - Building RESTful endpoints following best practices.
6. **Essential Additions** - Additional essential features for real-world projects.

## 💪 My Development
During this course, I aim to enhance my technical skills by focusing on:

- Modular and scalable architecture with **Nest.js**.
- Utilizing **Controllers and Services** for responsibility separation.
- Applying **data validation practices** with DTOs.
- Building **efficient REST APIs**.
- Exploring **widely used market tools**, improving my qualifications for real-world applications.

## 🌍 Technologies Used
- **Nest.js** - Node.js framework based on TypeScript.
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed JavaScript.
- **Class-validator / class-transformer** - DTO validation and transformation.
- **Postman / Insomnia** - API testing.
- **Docker** (Future) - For containerization and scalable deployment.

## 🔧 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nestjs-course.git

   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
4. Access the API via Postman or browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🏆 Progress and Conclusion
This project documents my learning journey with Nest.js, allowing me to consolidate concepts and practices used in the market. By the end of the course, I plan to create a practical project applying all the learned concepts.
